   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
5. Open https://localhost:5001 in your browser

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1. Choose a Task
- Check the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file for current tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on an issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch (Optional)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Submit a Pull Request
- Ensure your code builds successfully
- Write a clear PR description
- Reference any related issues
- Request review from maintainers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly)
- Use Blazor components for UI elements
- Implement JavaScript interop for complex libraries (Excalidraw, Tone.js, etc.)
- Follow Bootstrap CSS framework conventions
- Keep components modular and reusable

### Backend (Azure Functions)
- Write functions for specific, focused tasks
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow Azure Functions best practices

### Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments to public APIs
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Keep methods focused and testable

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
- Use xUnit testing framework

### Integration Tests
- Test Azure Function endpoints
- Verify database operations
- Test file upload/download workflows

### Cost-Aware Testing
- Test within Azure free tier limits
- Monitor function execution counts
- Validate storage usage

## üìä Cost Management

MindfulMuse is designed to run within Azure's always-free tier. Contributors should:

- **Monitor Usage**: Check Azure portal for usage metrics
- **Optimize Performance**: Minimize function execution time
- **Storage Awareness**: Be mindful of blob storage limits
- **Database Efficiency**: Use Cosmos DB RU/s efficiently

### Cost Control Checklist
- [ ] Function executions stay under 1M/month
- [ ] Blob storage under 5GB total
- [ ] Cosmos DB under 1K RU/s
- [ ] No unexpected charges in development

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear module switching interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions

### Color Scheme
- Primary: Bootstrap blue variants
- Secondary: Custom color palettes from design module
- Status: Green (success), Yellow (warning), Red (error)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Azure Security
- Use managed identities for Azure resources
- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Follow Azure security best practices

### Code Security
- Avoid hardcoding secrets
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add XML comments to public methods and classes
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add usage examples and screenshots
- Document configuration options

## ü§ù Code Review Process

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] Tests pass
